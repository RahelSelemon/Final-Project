Final Project: Escape From Gridworld
Can you find a path from a start location to goal location in a gridworld maze?

Getting started: 1) Create a _GitHub_ account if you don't already have one 2) Clone this GitHub repository _insert link_ into a directory of your choosing 3) Explore - Open the "puzzles" folder. We have provided a few puzzle files for you to test your implementation with but we encourage you to make more of your own - Open the stencil file. This is what you will be working in for most of the assignment

We have already written a few important function headers for you but you will be responsible for filling in the function bodies and splitting up the work into helper functions. Your main reponsiblities are indicated with a "TODO" comment.

Our expectations:

- Collaborate with your neighbors, brainstorm ideas, make friends, but don't copy code
- Use online resources and refer to program materials but don't use a chatbot.
- Do not change what's already part of the stencil without running it by one of the TAs first
- Ask for help as frequently as you want but we encourage you to STRUGGLE a bit
